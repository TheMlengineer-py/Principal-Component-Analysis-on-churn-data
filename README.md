# Principal-Component-Analysis-on-churn-data
“Can we identify the most important features influencing customer churn and use this information to develop targeted strategies to reduce churn”?
The goal of using PCA on the churn is to identify the most important factors affecting customer churn and develop targeted strategies to reduce churn. By performing PCA on these variables i.e. (Income, Outage_sec_perweek, Yearly_equip_failure, Tenure, Monthly Charge, Bandwidth_GB_Year), the underlying patterns and relationships among the variables can be established and reduce to a smaller number of principal components i.e. dimensional reduction.
These principal components can reveal the variance in the data and identify the most important factors affecting customer churn. For example, if the principal components related to high monthly charges and equipment failure are found to be the major causes of customer churn, then the organization can consider reducing the prices of their services or improving the quality of their equipment to retain more customers and reduce churn
